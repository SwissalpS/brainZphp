The story: a friend and I wanted to have a simple lightweight but private chat-channel of our own.
I threw together a quick script that allowed us to basically log in to an ssl server and post our messages to a file we both were presented.
The next step (uroxBrainZ) was to go memory only, no files on disk….well at least not personal info.
That meant moving from https to telnet protocol and from browser to terminal.
Now the connection procedure looks like this: one party runs the php server on a dynamic ip and opens an ssh port so the second party can
log in and then locally log in with telnet to the chat server. (also more parties possible)
I soon experimented with all kinds of ways to transparently run shell and php scripts. (only available to super duper users)
It turned out to be an excellent educational tool. Being able to demonstrate the use of commands and functions.
Also while collaborating on the same machine/network this was, I dear say, handier than ‘message’.
- no readline support as ‘lightweight’ also means not much pre installed on the host. I did write a little cocoa console with history support and to some extent, autocompletion.
keep an eye on my phocoa fork. I have this code integrated as I intend to have the https frontend using phocoa framework. The cocoa console will probably also first apear in that fork. They all belong together to a bigger bag of tools.
